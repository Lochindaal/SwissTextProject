\section{Literature review}
add more general stuff about \gls{stt}.

The shared task of a translating spoken Swiss German into standard written German was already presented by the \gls{stc} in 2020. While the current 2021 task is about reaching the highest BLEU score, last year's submissions where ranked based on the least \gls{wer}. \citet{buechi2020} achieved the best \gls{wer} of 40.29\%. The authors used a CNN acoustic model named Jasper. They used additional Standard German data and fine-tuned on the official data set. They used different augmentation techniques and a language model. \citet{pluss2020} add text. \cite{Kew2020} achieved the second best \gls{wer}. ... \\
\citet{agarwal2020} used an end-to-end model called DeepSpeech and achieved an \gls{wer} of 58.93\%. This is the model we decided to use as well. It is publicly available on GitHub and can easily be fine-tuned or used for transfer learning.
