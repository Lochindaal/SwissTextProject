\section{Introduction}
Swiss German has a wide variety of different dialects, with a huge difference in words, pronunciation, even to the point of sounding like a different language. Tackling a standardized translation of
different spoken Swiss German dialects into standardized German text requires a vast amount of data and fine tuning. The \gls{stc} 2021 proposed a shared task to tackle this problem and provided a dataset
(\gls{stcd} to train and fine tune on. This paper shows what kind of experiments, data, and approaches the authors used to tackle this problem.
