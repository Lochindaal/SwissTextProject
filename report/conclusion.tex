\section{Conclusion}
Although the other submissions to the task provided better results our model showed a constant increase in performance over the training time. Due to time limitations we had to stop training before our model has reached a point where it stopped improving. Overall, the DeepSpeech model provides a neat end-to-end architecture that provides a good basis for fine-tuning and adaptation to various languages.
