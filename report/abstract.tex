This paper presents a solution to the \gls{stc} shared task 3, 2021. The shared task challenges participants to implement models for translating Swiss German speech to standard German text. The authors implemented multiple \textit{DeepSpeech} models using the data provided by SwissText as well as additional data which lead to improvement of the model. An additional experiment with a sequence to sequence translation model was conducted in order to improve our score. We achieved a BLEU score of up to 0.17 on the test set of SwissText. Although the final model did not score well in comparison with other submissions, there is plenty of room for possible improvements.
