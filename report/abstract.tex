This paper analyzes and implemented models for the shared task 3 from the SwissText conference on translating swiss german speech to standard german text and presents the findings. We implemented multiple
\textit{DeepSpeech} models using the data provided by SwissText.org as well as additional data. An additional experiment with a sequence to sequence translation model was trained in order to improve our score. We achieved a BLEU score of up to 0.17 on the test set of SwissText.
