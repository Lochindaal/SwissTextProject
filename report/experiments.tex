\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}
We compared models on both the dataset provided by the \gls{stc} as well as the ArchiMob corpus. The \gls{stcd} contains 38 GB of labeled and 65 GB of unlabeled spoken swiss german audio data and an additional validation set
containing 1.5 GB of data \cite{stc2019}. The ArchiMob corpus (Release 2) contains X GB of spoken swiss german data \cite{archimob2016}.
\subsection{Experiments}

The base model of most our experiments was a pre-trained DeepSpeech model (release 9.0, get link!). The first model we trained served as our private baseline. We trained a bare DeepSpeech model on the SwissText labelled dataset.
