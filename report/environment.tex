\subsection{Environment or Setup?}
We train the model on a single XYZ GPU (XYG memory) for X epochs, with batch size of X and used a learning rate of XY, ....\\We perform minimal tuning of our model's hyperparameters following the work
of \newcite{pluss2020} as this model achieved the best results in previous challenges.
